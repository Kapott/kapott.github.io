Lifting my hands from the keyboard, clicking through applications to find the one I need - dragging it to where I want it and then maybe even resizing it... those are cognitive bumps. 

For neurotypical people this might come at a small cost, but it is still something that could theoretically interrupt the illusive flow state. For my brain, it's an open invitation to find the most distracting window and destroy the current train of thought.

Apart from the cognitive bump, there's also the physical one. I've been using computers for at least 6 hours a day since I was around 12 years old. I'm 41 at the time of writing. Erosion has taken it's toll. The only way I can consistently use a computer is by using all kinds of ergonomic gadgets and seeing if they alleviate pains in my arms, wrists and fingers. 

One of these gadgets is a split keyboard. The other is another keyboard layout which minimizes finger travel. And the most important one for both reducing armpain and preventing my brain from going into full-on dopamine-party mode (most of the time)? A tiling window manager.

There exist some extensions and hacks to bring the "tiling" part to other operating systems. Most notibly powertoys on windows and something like the 2024 Sequoia update, or the rectangles app on macos. Some of them are actually pretty good! But none capable enough to deeply integrate a decent standard workflow into.

Currently I use i3-wm with a pre-configured pane layout. Some contain applications in tabbed sections, some sections contain stacked applications, but all are well-thought out and firmly integrated into a near frictionless desktop experience. I'm not hung up on i3, but alternatives seem to require a big time investment with regards to customization.
