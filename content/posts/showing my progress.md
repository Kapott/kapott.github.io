People aren't interested in who you are, they're interested in what you're doing, what you're making. What are your thoughts, your process and what are the things you're considering? People care about people. It took me a long time to figure this one out. Mostly because - well - I don't. You see, I have autism. I don't really care about anything but the few people closest to me and my interests - whatever they might be at the time.
