I've been fortunate enough to not have to track my billables. Ever. And then I founded a software company. At first it was just me, and the work resembled freelancing; I'd show up, punch in, get paid stupid amounts per hour, and punch out.

  

One day, as I plopped down my trusty thinkpad on the flex-desk in officeville, corporate-town, I decided it would be prudent to run a full system upgrade before picking up my first ticket of the day.

Work did not get done that day. In my situation, that means I get paid just shy of a 1000 euros less. And I realized;

*No wobbly-window-with-transparency customization is worth this fucking much. My shit just always needs to work.*

Whilst I realize noone is ever 100% productive for an entire day, breaking a distro tanks that productivity to an absolute zero. Combine that with internal struggle to guide my own focus and even on a good day I'd have at least cheated myself out of two to three billable hours.

Switching to a mac seemed like a good idea back then. A least I wouldn't be able to waste my time with customizing yet another desktop environment, or breaking the OS during a workday. But this comes with an entirely new set of problems.

Look, I don't hate apple or macos. Whilst I'm not a fan either, I need to admit that their native apps are pretty great nowadays. Interlinking notes in the 'Notes' app, dragging tasks in reminders into the calendar - and being able to use the same app on all devices - definitely are big fat pro's. But there's something missing in the main workhorse OS...
