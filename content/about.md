Hello there. Thanks for taking the time to read something about me. I'll quickly summarize some things, so you can click whatever draws your focus.

## Entrepreneur

I love building stuff and I love it even more when the stuff I build helps out people. Turns out that solving problems for people is a good way to make money. The way I do it is guided by some mental supports I picked up throughout my life:

- keep it as simple as possible
- perfect is the enemy of done
- any functional complex system grows from a functional simple system which is iterated upon
- build tools that solve one thing, and solve it well

Not going to link what I made here, as that adds another layer of privacy protection for me and my family ;)

## Software developer

Being a software developer is simply a natural outcome of my desire to build and my addiction to puzzles and problem-solving. Computers provide the perfect medium for combining both in a rapid, continuous feedback loop.

The language doesn't really matter that much, and it can change depending on the requirement and expected need to scale. 

I'll use what I already know well enough to produce something if I want to be fast, I'll use whatever has the most available developers on the 'current jobmarket' if I need to create something enterprise-y which I'm not going to maintain myself in the future, and I'll use something fun if I want to experiment. 

Examples;

I want to be fast with development:
- Javascript, Nextjs, Node
- Python, Django, Flask
- Golang, net/http or Chi

I want to create something and need to find someone else to maintain it:
- Java, Spring, Hibernate
- Python, Django

I want to have fun:
- Haskell, Yesod
- Rust, Axum
- C

## hacker

I'm hesitant to use the term. But I do love exploring the interconnected network of AS'es and finding things that are off. 

Hacking sims like hack the box and tryhackme are excellent online puzzles which require an interconnected skillset and work really well for thinking laterally. Bugbounties allow me to scan and poke around without fear of repercussion.

I could do this all day, every day. This is like an infinite black hole, always exerting a pull on my conscious brain every time I encounter something off with tech. It's the "I wonder..." mental loop, applied to everything with an electronic interface.

## puzzles

Puzzles are about pattern recognition. Find the patterns, heuristics and algorithms that coalesce the parts into the finished product. Everything can be a puzzle - some puzzles just need knowledge from a broader required domain, or even multiple domains, to fully understand.

And that's how I approach puzzles. I try to acquire knowledge for a certain puzzle piece by trying to figure out what the pieces are and what knowledge I need in order to use the piece the right way. This way of doing things leads me into digging deep into things I need to know.

I'm fortunate enough to have basic understanding of math, physics, chemistry and biology on which I can grow other, often intertwining, "branches of understanding".

## tech

Whenever I say "tech", I mean the profound impact technology has made, makes and can make on both the individual as well as the group level. As our species progresses, we seem to rely more and more on technology. We're all already implicitly cyborgs - the expressed form is just different from what we've seen and read in scifi.
